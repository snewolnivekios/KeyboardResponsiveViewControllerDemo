// MARK: - Keyboard Responsive View Controller Extension

// HOW TO USE THIS EXTENSION
// 
// 1. Add a call to activateKeyboardResponsiveTextFields() in viewdidAppear().
// 2. Add a call to deactivateKeyboardResponsiveTextFields() in viewWillDisappear().
// 3. Add a call to view.endEditing(true) in viewWillDisappear().
